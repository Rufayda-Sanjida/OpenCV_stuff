first_frame.py = starts the camera, takes a pic, displays it using numpy, (can be saved)
"This is a basic example that shows how to get a single frame from the camera."

depth-image-animation-pygame.py
- this is for seeming the frame in real time

skeletal_tracking.py
- Real-time skeletal tracking using ML

rawparser.py
- used for when you save the adi stuff using bin and this script helps you view it
- parses recorded raw .bin frame files. You have raw binary files recorded from the camera.

- You want to visualize, extract, or process data offline.

- You want to generate datasets or analyze recordings.


saveCCBToFile.py
- Connects to the camera (USB or network).

- Reads the CCB (camera configuration binary) from device memory.

- Saves it as a .ccb file locally.


dual_cameras.py
- used for when you have 2 cameras 

data_collect.py
- used for saving images to disk
